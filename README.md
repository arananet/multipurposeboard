# The multipurpose board
This board allows to use any arduino project (because is based on a atmega328p) that involves an oled, a microsd and or even a voltmeter.

This board was initially designed for an Amiga Power Supply to display the output voltages of the Meanwell RT65. The project is described here http://blog.arananet.net/fabricando-una-fuente-de-alimentacion-para-amiga/

On the bom directory you will find the bom information and the pick and place information.

On the gerbers directly are the dual layer gerbers required to build this project.

On the Ino directory you will find the ino file that goes inside the atmega. You must upload this using the arduino IDE and the USBASP programmer. You can also upload the code via the TX and RX pins just like when you upload a code on a Arduino Pro Mini.

### THIS DESIGN OR THE RESULTING PCB IS PROHIBITED TO SALE ON EBAY.

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If you like the project or want to support it, you can buy me a beer or a KO-FI :)
