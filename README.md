# The multipurpose board
This board allows to use any arduino project (because is based on a atmega328p) that involves an oled, a microsd and or even a voltmeter.

This board was initially designed for an Amiga Power Supply to display the output voltages of the Meanwell RT65. The project is described here http://blog.arananet.net/fabricando-una-fuente-de-alimentacion-para-amiga/

On the bom directory you will find the bom information and the pick and place information.

On the gerbers directly are the dual layer gerbers required to build this project.

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
